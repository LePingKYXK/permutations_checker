# permutations_checker
A `Python 3` script for checking the permutation files generated by the CSM/CCM calculations.

## Modules required:
Numpy (version 1.13.0 or above)
Pandas (version 1.19.0 or above)

## Descriptions
This script deals with the checking and counting the unique permutations in the permutations.txt files, which were generated by the CSM/CCM calculations. 
First of all, the user would provide the directory, which contains the output subdirectories of all output files generated by the CSM/CCM calculations. For instance, `out_XXXX`, where XXXX is the name of the input file. 
The script will findi all permutations.txt files in the subdirectories and then read the permutations information one file by another. In each `permutations.txt` file, collecting and counting the unique permutations then save them in a `.csv` file.

## Usage
`python` `permutations_checker.py` `PATH` `METHOD`
- PATH:   the directory go down to the subdirectory of `out_XXXX`, where XXXX is the name of the input file.
          For example, if the directory is like `/out_XXXX`
- METHOD: the cutting method and the residure for the proteins, e.g. Ramachandran_ALA.
          It is just for clarification of the name of `.csv` file.
